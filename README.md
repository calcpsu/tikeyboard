# Keyboard for TI Majestic Series Calculators #

1970's TI calculatore keyboards are known for failure - squishy or dead keys - leading to premature death.
As the original keyboards are generally unrepairable, this is a replacement using a PCB and micro tactile switches.
Enjoy the use of technology advanced during the mobile phone era (0.8mm thickness tact switches!).

## Details: ##

The PCB + switch comes to 2.4mm thick, which is nearly identical to the original 2.2mm thick keyboard in these calculators.

Two versions are included:
* 5 Column x 8 Row: made for a TI45, but I understand should also fit a standard TI30
* 5 Column x 9 Row: suits a TI58, TI59 programmable

## Swtich Type: ##

Switches are a reasonably common SMD type (Dimensions: 4.8mm x 4.8mm x 0.8mm) available from electrical component wholesalers and elsewhere online at low cost.
As long as it matches the drawing below, it should be compatible.
